How Properties of Mime Types are used by SQL Mode\n  =================================================\n\n  keywords:\n    A list of keywords you want to be highlighted.\n  builtin:\n    A list of builtin types you want to be highlighted (if you want types to be of class \"builtin\" instead of \"keyword\").\n  operatorChars:\n    All characters that must be handled as operators.\n  client:\n    Commands parsed and executed by the client (not the server).\n  support:\n    A list of supported syntaxes which are not common, but are supported by more than 1 DBMS.\n    * ODBCdotTable: .tableName\n    * zerolessFloat: .1\n    * doubleQuote\n    * nCharCast: N'string'\n    * charsetCast: _utf8'string'\n    * commentHash: use # char for comments\n    * commentSlashSlash: use // for comments\n    * commentSpaceRequired: require a space after -- for comments\n  atoms:\n    Keywords that must be highlighted as atoms,. Some DBMS's support more atoms than others:\n    UNKNOWN, INFINITY, UNDERFLOW, NaN...\n  dateSQL:\n    Used for date/time SQL standard syntax, because not all DBMS's support same temporal types.\n*/\n"],"sourceRoot":""}
